# SCMX Simulation

This project simulates a simple Supply Chain Management (SCMX) model with three main actors: Supplier, Manufacturer, and Retailer. The simulation demonstrates inventory flow, order processing, and basic supply chain strategies like Lean, Agile, and JIT.

## Features

- Simulates daily operations of each supply chain node.
- Models stock levels, production, and ordering processes.
- Supports different supply chain modes (Lean, Agile, JIT) with randomized demands and lead times.
- Console-based output for easy tracking of simulation steps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) or command-line tools

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scmx-simulation.git
